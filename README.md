This is a collection of tasks in which I am playing with canvas and I created just for fun or while trying new things.

#### 1. `create-shapes-animation`
The entire browser's window is a canvas. User can click anywhere on the screen. Each subsequent click creates a random shape (circle/rectangle), in a random size and it appears where the mouse was clicked. The shape moves in a random speed and bounces from the screen borders.

#### 2. `journey-canvas`

Landing page with canvas. When you load the page use scroll of the mouse or trackpad to scroll the page back and ford. Also you can click on the bubbles. This will scroll the page back and ford and show you specific messages depends on which bubbles you clicked. <br />
