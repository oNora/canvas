####1. `create-shapes-animation`
The entire browser's window is a canvas. User can click anywhere on the screen. Each subsequent click creates a random shape (circle/rectangle), in a random size and it appears where the mouse was clicked. The shape moves in a random speed and bounces from the screen borders.
